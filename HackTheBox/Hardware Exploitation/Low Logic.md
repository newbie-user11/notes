The picture at the bottom is a circuit diagram of a Transistor-Transistor Logic *NAND gate*. To understand, a real world instance of NAND gate is a thermostat with temperature sensors A and B on different ends of a room. When sensor detects temperature as equal to temperature set by user, the sensors turn on which is denoted as 1 or true. When detected temperature falls below set temperature, the sensor turns off which is denoted as 0 or false. If either sensor is on, aircon turns off. If both sensors are off, aircon turns on (Table 1).

| Sensor A | Sensor B | Heater |     |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | :-: |
| 0        | 0        | 1      | ON  |
| 0        | 1        | 0      | OFF |
| 1        | 0        | 0      | OFF |
| 1        | 1        | 0      | OFF |

It has four inputs for electric current ãƒ¼ IN 0, IN 1, IN 2, and IN 3.
Each of the four inputs is connected to a transistor that diverges the current in two different directions. The collectors of each transistor is connected to 1) a diode that allows current to flow in only one direction and 2) a resistor that reduces the current intensity.
All inputs meet to provide output at OUT 0.
