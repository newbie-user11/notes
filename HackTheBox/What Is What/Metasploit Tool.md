Metasploit is a tool for proxying, then utilising the proxy to scan for security vulnerabilities in communication between end user and server.
- This tool also has the function of scanning into the server for sensitive files such as *robot.txt*. 
- If this file can be accessed through metasploit, it has not been hidden properly. This is an example of a vulnerability requiring fixing.
