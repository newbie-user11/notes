A web proxy tool allows scanning for vulnerabilities on chosen target(s). To choose target(s) in Burp Suite, there are a two ways. Either a HTTP request or the entire website through crawling. 
# Single Request Scan 
Under HTTP history, right click chosen request and select scan option.
# Web Crawling
This option maps out the entire website. Select *Target* menu. Under Site map, choose the target request. Right click it, then *add to scope*. 
With this option, selecting relevant target and deselecting targets that trigger a forced logout is important to avoid having to start over.
