Simply assuming a webpage exists, then confirming whether it does or does not. 
To confirm whether a webpage exists, a potentially existing webpage is requested. If it exists, the webpage opens with a 200 OK response. If it does not exist, a not found 404 response is returned.

It is common to fuzz for a list of potentially existing webpages. Such a list is entered into a wordlist text file.
