- Characters such as ! " # $ ' are on a webpage, must be encoded for processing by web browser.
- If not encoded, webpage is not displayed properly.
- Format of encoded characters is **%2x**. 
	- **%2** remain constant.
	- **x** is a number between 0 to 9.

- For instance, %21 is *space*, and %22 is ".
	It can be said that a change in unit place changes the character that is encoded.
