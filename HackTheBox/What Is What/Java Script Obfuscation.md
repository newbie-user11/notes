Java script is made hard to read or obfuscated to make the code harder to read by humans. Intended reason for obfuscation is to protect source code from being copied or used without permission from whom developed the code.
Obfuscation involves defining symbols and random characters with functions such as movement and animation. Those symbols are used to assign function.
Obfuscated java script is relatively slower but functions the same way on de-obfuscation. De-obfuscation process involves making a dictionary of the used symbols and characters to provide the actual code.
