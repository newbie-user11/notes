*This information is only for the purposes of education and skills development. GET and POST are not acronyms.*

**Objective**
Access administrator interface and delete user named *Carlos*.

**SSRF**
- In Server Side Request Forgery the attacker forges a request that results in the server unintendedly making an unauthorised request.

**Point of Entry**
- The admin panel is at `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`. Access without admin login is blocked.
- On any product page, use *Check Stock* function and see that its POST request contains `stockApi` header. This is our point of entry. 

**Barrier to Entry**
- Changing the value of `stockApi` header does not work. 

**Bypassing Barrier to Entry** 
- Click on *Next Product* and observe that the generated GET request contains a `path` parameter in header.
- The parameter indicates open redirection to next product page. 
- Such redirection can be used as value of stockApi to access admin panel through redirection.

**Template**
`/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
