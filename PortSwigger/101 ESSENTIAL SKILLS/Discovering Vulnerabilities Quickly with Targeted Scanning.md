**Objective**
Retrieve contents of `/etc/passwd` within ten minutes.

**Focus Points**
1. Use Burp Scanner to automate identification of vulnerabilities.
2. In interest of time, narrow down requests based on intuition.
3. Scan requests that are potentially vulnerable to attacks by right clicking and scanning.
4. A report listing vulnerabilities in code and severity of associated risk will be provided for each scan.
5. Use this information to conduct an audit of the risk of contents of `/etc/passwd` being revealed.
