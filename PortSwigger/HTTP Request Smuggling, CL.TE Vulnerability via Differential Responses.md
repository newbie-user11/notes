**Objective**
Issue request that retrieves a 404 not found response.

**HTTP Request Smuggling**
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol request smuggling involves bypassing security controls. 
- This is to gain unauthorised access to sensitive data and directly compromise other users' application instance.
- Primarily associated with HTTP/1 requests, websites that support HTTP/2 may also be vulnerable depending on backend architecture.

**Execution**
- This website has CL.TE vulnerabilities, meaning it uses the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers.
- A request can be manipulated to receive a desired malicious response.
- Open homepage of the website. A GET / request will be issued for the website. Send it to Repeater. 
- Replace the request headers and body with the template payload. Send request twice.
- The second response should return a *404 server not found* response.

**Template Payload**
`POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 35 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 GET /404 HTTP/1.1 X-Ignore: X`
