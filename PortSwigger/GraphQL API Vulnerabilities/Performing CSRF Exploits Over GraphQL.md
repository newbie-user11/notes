**Objective**
Conduct CSRF using GraphQL based request.

**GraphQL**
- It is an API query language for communication between the client and server. 
- Efficiency is its main feature, enabling users to request and receive the exact information required.

**Point of Entry**
Email address change POST request. The endpoint accepts requests with content type `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**Execution**
- Open login page. Login using provided credentials. Then change the email address to a random address. Send the generated request to repeater. 
- Find that replacing the email address with a different address in the request changes it a second time. This indicates that session cookies can be reused.
- Change the request method twice to add a `Content-Type` header to the POST request. Notice that this process removes the GraphQL mutation from request body.
- Add the mutation from template to the request. Generate a CSRF PoC by right clicking the request. Copy the payload generated.
- Host the payload on Exploit server and deliver to victim.

**Template**
Mutation request: `query=%0A++++mutation+changeEmail%28%24input%3A+ChangeEmailInput%21%29+%7B%0A++++++++changeEmail%28input%3A+%24input%29+%7B%0A++++++++++++email%0A++++++++%7D%0A++++%7D%0A&operationName=changeEmail&variables=%7B%22input%22%3A%7B%22email%22%3A%22hacker%40hacker.com%22%7D%7D`
