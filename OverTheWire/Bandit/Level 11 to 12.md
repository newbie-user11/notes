Locate data.txt as done for level 9 and 10. The catch to this file is that the password characters have been rotated. Meaning that each alphabet has been replaced by an alphabet that is 13 positions further. So, the initial alphabet +12. 

After using the cat command to read our password file, use the tr command to decode the rotation: `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`

Password to level 12:
