General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), also known as strong AI or human-level AI, is a hypothetical AI that possesses human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It's distinct from narrow or weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks. AGI aims to replicate the broad cognitive abilities of humans, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and creativity, across diverse domains. Currently, AGI remains a long term research goal and does not exist yet.
