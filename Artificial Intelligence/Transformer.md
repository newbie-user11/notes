A transformer is a neural network architecture that has transformed natural language processing. Unlike sequential models, transformers process input simultaneously by capturing connections between distant parts of a sequence by relying on what are called long-range dependencies. Attention mechanisms weigh importance to different points in input, improving context understanding. This parallel processing makes them effective for tasks like translation and text generation. Transformers are now dominant in many AI applications.
