Zero-shot task transfer is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one set of tasks can perform on a completely *unseen* task without any specific training examples for that new task. 
The model leverages its existing knowledge from initial training to generalise and make predictions on the new task. 
Essentially, it's like learning to ride a bicycle and then being able to ride a motorcycle without ever having ridden one before â€“ transferable skill.
